    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>4 to 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>4 slices of American cheese</li>
        <li>burger toppings of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. 
            Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.
        </li>
        <li>Spread butter on the insides of the buns. Toast the flat top until it turns a bit brown.</li>
        <li>
            Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each.<br />
            Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly.<br />
            Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment<br />
            and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas<br />
            that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down.<br />
            Sprinkle the meat with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color.<br />
            Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese.<br />
            Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds. Stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.<br />
            If you only have one spatula, wrap your other hand in an old dish towel for protection, <br />
            and use it to press down on the spatula with both hands.<br />
        </li>
    </ol>
